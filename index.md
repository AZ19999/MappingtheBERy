# Project Information(not final)

This project is a historical mapping of the Boston Elevated Railway, the company that would turn into the Metropolitan Transit Authority and then eventually the Massachussetts Bay Transportation Authority. The large map has been assembled to see the expansion and evololution of the companhy from an independent collection of rail and coach lines into a unified body that would provide affordable intercity transport for the citizens of Boston. In addition to having a visualization of Boston's Rail history, There is also an accompanying sentiment and financial(pending) analysis to help showcase the more real effects of the rail expansion. With this, we can see where the growth has been favorable and where the current transit authority needs to help shore up issues that have carried over from the 20th century.

# Why this project?

 At Boston College, I hoped to pursue studies in Digital Humanities and this project has been a sort of culmination of all of that work. As a student who lives not on campus, the T has been a subtle, but important part of my school life. I ride it to school everyday and I've never really given it much thought. Last year, during the particular rough red line shutdowns as the new MBTA management tries to bring the T out of a state of disrepair and neglect, I began to think more about what being a rider of the T meant. This led me to making it the central topic of an archives class I took last semester. In this class, I hope to extend that work and create something that goes just a bit beyond the scope of that project.
